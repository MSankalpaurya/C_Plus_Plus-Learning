 * 1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
 * Priority queues are extensively used in Dijkstra’s algorithm 
 * to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
 * In this algorithm, nodes are processed in order of their
 * distance from the source node, which can be managed using a 
 * priority queue.

 * Huffman Coding (Data Compression)

    Huffman coding is an algorithm used for data compression.
    A priority queue is used to construct a binary tree where each node’s priority is based on the frequency of characters in the data.

CPU Task Scheduling

    In operating systems, processes with different priorities are managed using a priority queue.
    Tasks with higher priority (like real-time operations) can preempt other tasks.

A Search Algorithm (Pathfinding)*

    A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm that uses a priority queue to expand nodes with the lowest estimated cost to the goal.
    The priority queue ensures that the next node processed is the one that’s most promising in terms of reaching the goal quickly.
