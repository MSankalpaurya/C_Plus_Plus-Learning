/**
 * TOPIC:Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
 * 
 *  A deque (pronounced "deck") is a special type of queue that allows 
 *  insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the
 *  back. It combines the features of a stack (LIFO) and a queue
 *  (FIFO). Deques are more versatile than standard queues, and
 *  they are implemented as a part of the STL in C++.
 * 
 *  In C++, deque is used to implement both stack and queue
 *  operations because of its flexibility. Unlike a standard
 *  queue where elements are inserted at the back and removed
 *  from the front, a deque allows these operations at both ends.
 * 
 * Common operations on a deque:

    push_front(x): Insert x at the front.
    push_back(x): Insert x at the back (like queue.push(x)).
    pop_front(): Remove the element from the front (like queue.pop()).
    pop_back(): Remove the element from the back.
    front(): Access the element at the front.
    back(): Access the element at the back.
